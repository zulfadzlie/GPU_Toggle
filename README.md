PowerShell Script to Toggle Between Internal and External GPUs

Description:
This repository contains a PowerShell script that toggles between the internal and external GPUs on a system. It is useful for scenarios where a system has both an integrated GPU and a dedicated GPU.

Note:
Before running the script, make sure to review and modify it according to your specific GPU models.
The script currently contains placeholders for GPU names (e.g., "NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Ti" and "Intel(R) UHD Graphics 620"), which you should replace with the actual names of your GPUs.
